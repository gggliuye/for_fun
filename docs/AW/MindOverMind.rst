Mind Over Mind
====================

Vicious Circle
-----------------

The Buddha said that wisdom must come only from the abandoment of selfish craving or desire.
One who abandons that desire attains **Nirvana** (涅槃), which is superme peace, liberation.
Nirvana means in Sanskrit "blow out", that is exhale the breath, the opposite, desire is to
breath in. If you breathe in and hold it, you lose your breath. But if you breath out, it
comes back to you. **If you want life, don't cling to it, let go.**

But the problem is, if we desire not to desire, is that already a desire?
How can I surrender myself when myself is precisely an urge to hold on, to cling.


Improve Yourself?
-----------------------

The person who is going to do the improving is the one who needs to be improved.

**上德不德，是以有德；下德不失德，是以无德。**

**The highest virtue is not virtue and therefore really is virtue. But inferior virtue
cannot let go of being virtuous and therefore is not virtuous.**
The highest virtue is not conscious of itself as virtue and therefore really is virtue.
Lower virtue is so self-conscious that it's not virtue.
In other words, when you breathe you don't cingratulate yourself on being virtuous,
but breathing is a great virtue, it's living.

If you are really aware of your own inner workings, you will realize there's nothing you can
do to improve yourself. Because you don't know that better is, in any case. And you, who do the
improving are the one who needs to be improved. (It also goes for societies.)

If you see that you can't outwit yourself, you can't be unselfconscious on purpose,
you can't be designedly spontaneous, and you can't be genuinely loving by intending to love.

Supposing we can't do anything to change ourselves.

Why come to school? A: you're interested in something, you don't come to improve yourself.
But the trouble is the schools got the wrong idea, they give people honors for learning.
The reward for studying French (for an example) should be the ability to speak and enjoying reading
and having fun with french people. While now the degree becomes the point.

The whole idea of self-imprvement is will of the wisp and a hoax

Just watch, and don't be in a hurry to think you know what it is.
When you select an authority ("authority" is just your opponion) who will help you to improve yourself.
It's like hiring the police out of your tax money and putting them in charge of seeing
that you obey the law.

Your idea of GOD is your idea of GOD, the "authority" is the one we brought.
