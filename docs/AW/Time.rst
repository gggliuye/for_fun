Time
----------------------

An old optical illusion, the length of lines of perspective vision.
An illusion we are so used and so easily fooled.
**MAYA** : a word of indian philosophy, basicly meaning "illusion", or rather illusion brought about : "By
the exceptions of certain conventions." when we are not aware certain things we are token for grounded,
when we are not aware this is a matter of convention, we are about to be fooled.
**Time** is the convention more easier to fool us.

Humane "A time binding animal": a creature who is vivdly aware that his life as it was along a line
from the past, through the present, and into the future. While animals tend to live moment by moment.
Which gives us the ability to better plan the future. While we miss the truth that :
**The true reality that we live, is the present moment "now".**
