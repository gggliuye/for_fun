First point, Alan is not to say eastern culture is better. And the philosphy ideas that had been talked
are held by only quiet a minority of people in Asia. These are ideas from another part of the world,
from a minority of people in that other part of the world, which are of possible use to us.

Second question, "death and rebirth" as their found in Hinduism and Buddhism.  You will go to the
same blankness, out of which you came.Although death involves the
destruction of the memory, and therefore of what we call our 'I' or 'ego'. Nevertheless there isn't
just a blank after death. But rather that nature fills the vacuum created by unconsciousness, with a
new consciousness.

Third question. The eastern idea, came from Hinduism Buddhism Taoism or so, that all life is
fundamental one, and the height of wisdom, consists in some way, to experience the unity of life.
But it seems undetectable, but then how can you talk about there being an experience of it?
The answer is that, there is knowledge obtained by participation ("如眼能看不自看"), other than
the knowledge by standing by.

For an example, when you listening to a concert. You don't realize that you are "listening" to the music.
You as it was, become the music, in listening to it. And in this moment you are one with your experience.
The same thing happening through your life. So to 'grasp' the oneness of life, you mustn't try to get
it by thinking, you have to get it by going right into your life as it happens.
