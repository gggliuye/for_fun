Stoicism
===================

Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in
the early 3rd century BC. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to
eudaimonia (happiness, or blessedness) for human beings is to act in accord with their
nature, meaning being rational and social beings at every moment.
