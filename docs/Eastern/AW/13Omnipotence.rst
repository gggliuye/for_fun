13 Omnipotence
===================

Understanding the world.

* The way of description. The way of understanding things in words and in terms. The linear view.
* The way of seeing. The way of understanding through seeing and looking a field or a subject totally all at once. The total view.

In western view, we may see things as being constructed or made, as we linearly understanding it, by a
step by step process (parts are all apart, then assampled).

While in eastern view, the world is **grown**, it grows itself. It expands constellations
its own parts from within itself, coming into being altogether once.

14 Zen Life
=====================

**Dharma dhatu**  A world, where everything is related to everything else (~ A spider Net, vertices and edges).
The world is so closely related to each other, one thing can only exist, which inter-related
to others.
(In other words, I don't know what is empty hand, unless I know a hand with some. I don't know motion, unless
I see something moving.)

**无为** (from this point of view) : nothing acts of itself, no such a thing as a agent, for action is the nature of the whole thing.
As it appears in one place, in relation with a stillness or others.

**Deceptions** (which do not exist, while human invent them to make standards for society):

* **THINGS** to talk about the world, we have to 'divide' it into verious different units, pretend things are separable (as is talked in Lecture 2 Things and think).
* **AGENTS** that human individual is a separated thing, orginating actions, and responds for it. In this inter-connection view, actions do not start at any particular spot, it is a property of the whole field. While for running human socity, we treat everyone a responsable agents.
* **REWARDS & PUNISHMENTS**. We act as a fully responsable agent, act according to it, to obatin the future "rewards". There are advantages in planning the future, while we are living fully now.

These creative deceptions are made to make our sciety more organized, and easier to contorl.
They are like rafts, it help to cross the river. while if keep it all the way after, it will become a burden.
Zen is to free people from these burdens, to recover the view of the world with ful connectivities.
(there is no agent ego to "do" with it, nor "not do" with it.)
