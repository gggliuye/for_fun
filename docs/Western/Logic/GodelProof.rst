Godel Proof
============================

Kurt Friedrich Gödel (German, April 28, 1906 – January 14, 1978) was a logician, mathematician, and philosopher.
Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history,
Gödel had an immense effect upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such
as Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, and David Hilbert were using logic and set theory to investigate the
foundations of mathematics, building on earlier work by the likes of Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor and Frege.
