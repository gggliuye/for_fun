13 Omnipotence
===================

Understanding the world.

* The way of description. The way of understanding things in words and in terms. The linear view.
* The way of seeing. The way of understanding through seeing and looking a field or a subject totally all at once. The total view.

In western view, we may see things as being constructed or made, as we linearly understanding it, by a
step by step process (parts are all apart, then assampled).

While in eastern view, the world is **grown**, it grows itself. It expands constellations
its own parts from within itself, coming into being altogether once.
