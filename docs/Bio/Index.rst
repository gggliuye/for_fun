Human Behavioral Biology
========================

`A list of Robert Sapolsky's Lectures in youtube <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7E21BF91F3F9683>`_ ,
`My notes and relative documents <https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlcTaQw_X72KhF-bB4_y_Oj85Bl7?e=hBeu45>`_ .

One of my favorite sentences :

"The same exact bioloy may make somebody a schizophrenic in a milder form,
will have them being very interested in meta-magical issues, and in the mildest
form allows you to have a fantasy while standing on line in the supermarket.
It's the same biology on the same continuum, and somewhere in there, it stops
being *them and their diseases* and becomes *us and who we are*."
