4. The Void
===============

"禅" (Zen in Japanese, Chan in Chinese), "DHYANA" in Indian Sanskrit word, which represents
a kind of experience of circle, which is a form of "SUNYA", **The Void**.
The basic of Buddism and Daoism, as *The way of expericening a way of feeling* (different from the
wastern regilions, which is mainly concerned with briefs).

悟
----------

The Void rather represents complete spiritual freedom. **"悟" in quiet a sudden, you became totally
convinced that the way everything is in the universe and at this moment is absolutly right.** A sudden
feeling that everything is right the way it is now, however appalling, however terrible, and you know it
beyond a shadow of doubt.

* Feeling that everything just as it is so right that you could say of it : this is why I'am alive, this is what life is all about.
* Everything you see and feel seems to come to life in an extraorindary way that you feel the world as you've seen it before, but seen almost in a dream. But it is just the ordinary things that were confronting you, suddenly went to alive.
* You no longer feel yourself and what you are experiencing to be seperated. Although you don't lose the feeling of the outline of your skin, you don't forget your name, nevertheless the suddenly seems to you that you skin is no longer what divides you from the world, it's what joins you to it. What you see outside you is also you.

We ordinary think as ourself the controlling center, while in this experience, the center were suddenly enlarged
to include the whole universe. You almost feel as if you were God, except that in Eastern thought, one doesn't
think of God as a kind of omnipotent person. It is this feeling that you and this whole world are one.
And in this experience of oneness and the sudden coming alive of everything, the profound rightness of this moment
however far it may seem to be short of one's ideals of perfection. This is it.

Freedom is dangerious. This experience is risky. **Nirvana**.

One
-------------

You cannot in complete control of your whole life situation. You cannot in other words, fundamentally
posses yourself. So the problem is set, to try to find out who you are, who is knower behind your
experience, who is the experiencer, who is the ego the eye. And make you search for it, search for it, search for it.
That is to ask you to show the real basic original self and this means perform an absolutely 100 percent
genuiue and sincere act.

While when you try to be natural you know very well your trying and that everything you do is a fake.
So, we found that we cannot act 100 percent genuinely with this whole deal. So he try again and again
and again, while the teacher rejects every attempt he makes to show him his real self.

Until the moment comes when he suddenly realizes not just an idea but something he knows in his whole
body, he knows that from his very bones, that it can't be done. You cannot intentionally be natural
and he gives up. While in that moment there comes upon us this experience of the void of complete
freedom or being free form blocking.
