The Existence of Soul
======================

Dualism and Physicism
----------------------

The relationship of body and soul(mind).

* The body and the mind are different representations (or cognitions) of the same thing.
* Dualism (interactive) : The body and mind are two seperate things with very tight connection. And death might be the seveing of the connection.


In the assumption of the **Dualism**:

* Are body and soul distinct. (i.e. are there soul?)
* If there are soul, can soul survives the death of the body?
* If survive, how long? Does it continue to exist forever?

Soul are reserved for immaterial stuff, it may not have a physics location.

**Materialist** view : people is just a material object, just a "body" (but not any old body) that can do some amazing things. For example, "smile" ( "mind" in our case here), the materialists don't deny smile. Talking about smile, is actually talking about the body ability to smile. There is mind, and talking about "The Mind", is actually talking about the body ability to do various things. Death is just the breaking down of the body, so it will not function any more.

"Mind" is talking about the abilities of the body. And we all admit its existence.

(*Metaphysics : a division of philosophy that is concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being and that includes ontology, cosmology, and often epistemology*)

Is there soul?
----------------------

1. Inference to the best explanation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Inference to the best explanation**. Something we say exist, is that we can see, touch or feel it. How can we tell the existance of "soul" when we can't feel it. For an example "atoms", we infer the exitence of atoms, because it can explain things (physics laws). We infer the existence of thins we cannot see, to explain something we can't otherwise explain.
So, we should always choose the best explanation. So we will infer to the "Inference to the best explanation", to find something to which "soul" could offer a best explanation.

For the existence of soul : *Are there things about us that the physicalist cannot explain?* could give us some reason to believe the soul. **Feature P (people)** : One aspect, the ordinary thing about us, another aspect, the super-nature things.

2. Ordinary things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Ordinary things**  :
* What animates the body? Must there be something outside the body that control the body? We are different from the robots, do we need soul to explain **free will** ?
* The ability to think, reason, brief, desires, make strategies, etc. For example, the computer playing programmings. What grouds are there for withholding ascriptions of beliefs and desires to the computer? Are we just using asumptions to "argue" the argument? That's far from obvious. Are these just illusions? Maybe there is a **action side** and an **emotional side** of the desires (that machines don't have). Then it lead to the question : *Could a purely physics being feel emotions?*

3. Emotion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Emotion** : we have the behavioral aspect of feeling, and the sensation part of *what the feeling feels like* (or we call it **qualitative experiences** ) . For dualism point of view, a pure physice body cannot have the sensation part of emotion. For example, can blind people "feel" red? He have the notation of the red color, knows the apple is read, while in the mean time, he cannot actually have the feeling of feel red (as he cannot really see). The materialist may argue : we are not yet able to explain soul in physical view, is not equal to we won't possibly able to explain it (For an example, life in 14th century) .  And we don't want any explanation, we want a better explanation. So one may ask : how soul can have conciousness?  and we cannot answer it. *This is actually a tie.*

4.Creativity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Creativity** : could there be a pyhsics object that is creative? Chess playing programs could create strategies, there are mathematical theorem proving programs, and programs could create music and arts.

5. Free Will
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Free Will** : But all the programs are automatically, mechanically following the code. It seems that it does not have free will. And the assumption that we (human) have free will is based on the following arguments.

* <u>We have free will.</u>
* <u>Nothing subject to determinism has free will (Incompatibilism).</u> While many people hold the compatibilism, that the determinism and free will are compatible.
* <u>All purely physical systems are subject to determinism.</u> However, the fundamental laws of physics are not in fact deterministic. Instead, it is probabilistic, according to the standard inerpretation of quantum mechanics.
* <u>So, we are not a purely physical system.</u>

6. Near Death Experiences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Death experiences, while then drawed back to life.*

One explanation : the person dead, then went to another "world". The objection goes that they never really die, how can they tell "the permanently dead". While the experiences should still count for some degree.

Physics explanation : "One room(world)" metaphom, death, go close the wall of the room, everything will be a bit different. Life is a biology process, near death will trigger some different biological process. Still waiting for scientific evidences.

**Seance**

So far, no good reason to go beyond physicism.

7. Cartesian argument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Cartesian thought experiment**, *we could imagine that our mind exist without the body*. If the body and the mind are the same entity, we cannot imagine such things (we cannot tell a story that the table exist while the table does not exist). If we can tell a story that A exists while B does not exist, does it follow that A and B are not the same thing ? If B is just another word to express A, it cannot happen that A exists while B doesn't exist. *So talking about my mind cannot be just talking about my body?*

We could consider the examples:

* A : left hand, B : right hand;
* A : body, B : smile;
* A : nom, B : prenom;
* A : mind, B : body;
* <u>A : evening star, B : morning star</u>

For the case of evening star and morning star, we know that they are actullay the same entity, the Venus, whether I am aware of it or not. But maybe something went wrong here, otherwise the Descartes's argument won't hold (actually the Prof think the argument doesn't work in person). Many people argues about where this statement goes wrong:

* This statement may be misdescribed that the world you are imagining went wrong.
* Imagining doesn't mean logically possible (For an example, try to imagine a round square, we will start to trying).
* Identity is not necessary, but contingent.

Summary
-------------------------

**No satisfying statement achieved.**
