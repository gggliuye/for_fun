Time
----------------------

An old optical illusion, the length of lines of perspective vision.
An illusion we are so used and so easily fooled.
**MAYA** : a word of indian philosophy, basicly meaning "illusion", or rather illusion brought about : "By
the exceptions of certain conventions." when we are not aware certain things we are token for grounded,
when we are not aware this is a matter of convention, we are about to be fooled.
**Time** is the convention more easier to fool us.

Humane "A time binding animal": a creature who is vivdly aware that his life as it was along a line
from the past, through the present, and into the future. While animals tend to live moment by moment.
Which gives us the ability to better plan the future (which is ofcourse, very important for us).
While we miss the truth that : **The true reality that we live, is the present moment "now".**

We spend a lot living in time, which is not here, in else-where, which is not concrete real.
So much so, that although we are quiet satisfied about our current circumstances.
If there is not a guarantee or a promise that a good time coming tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow,
we are once unhappy, even we are in the mid of pleasure.
So we develop a chronic anxiety about time. we want asure more and more, beause our feelings'
sensitivity of time. As a consequence, the future becomes more important for some people than the present.

We live so much in the future. School to college to work to etc... You are always living in somewhere, where you aren't.

Planning for future is useful, while if we always live in the future, one can never enjoy the fruit of actions.
**You cannot live at all, unless you are living fully now !**
